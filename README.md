# tdd-ddd-go

This project is a playground for TDD (Test-Driven Development) and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) with Golang.

## Sample Project
Small Membership Library System.

The role of Domain Expert is played by ChatGPT.

### Overview

**Scale**
→ Approximately 50 members. About 2,000 books in the collection. A few volunteer staff members.

**Features**

- Not a typical public library (intended for a closed community)

- Not everyone can become a member. Membership requires a referral or an evaluation.

- Book purchases are funded by membership fees or donations.

- Lending and returning are completely self-service (though records must be kept in the management system).

- Some books can be sold (donated books can be sold in a flea market style).

**Basic Business Flow**

- Member registration (with evaluation)

- Book registration (ISBN code, title, author information)

- Book lending

- Book returning

- Reporting of lost or damaged books

- Membership fee management

- Acceptance of book donations

- Book sales (available to interested parties)
